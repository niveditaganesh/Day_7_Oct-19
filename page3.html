<h2>THE TALLEST STATUE IN THE WORLD-The Statue of Unity</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p>The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first Deputy Prime Minister and 
    Home minister of independent India and adherent of Mahatma Gandhi during the non-violent Indian Independence movement.  </p>
    <p>Patel was highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India with a major part of the former British Raj to form the single Union of India. 
        The statue is located in the state of Gujarat, India. </p>
        <p>It is the world's tallest statue with a height of 182 metres (597 feet).It is located on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres southeast of the city of Vadodara</p>

</div>
<div class="col-6">
<p>Narendra Modi first announced the project to commemorate Vallabhbhai Patel on 7 October 2013 at a press conference to mark the beginning of his 10th year as
     The Chief Minister of Gujarat. At the time, the project was dubbed, "Gujarat's tribute to the nation".</p>
     <p>A separate Society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was formed under the chairmanship
          of the Chief minister, Government of Gujarat, to execute the project.</p>
          <p>An outreach drive named the Statue of Unity Movement was started to support the construction of the statue. 
              It helped collect the iron needed for the statue by asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-4">
<p>In a superconducting material, electrical current can flow with zero resistance, meaning these losses don’t occur.
    This property has made such materials extraordinarily sought-after, but until now getting them to work has required very low temperatures and extremely high pressures.
    </p>
    <p>Now physicists from the U.S. have shown superconductivity at 15 degrees Celsius. They used a high pressure device called a diamond anvil cell to compress and alter the properties. </p>
    <p>Because of the limits of low temperature, materials with such extraordinary properties have not quite transformed the world in the way that many might have imagined.This material could be used in applications ranging from quantum computing to building better MRI machines reducing energy waste from electricity transmission.

<p>Recently, a distant collision between a black hole and a mystery object was revealed. At first glance, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory 
    (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer, detected waves from this collision in August 2019. Here is everything you need to know about this bizarre collision.</p>

<hr/>
<p style="color: crimson;">the mid-size objects tend to be between about 2.5 and three solar masses</p>

<p>As per the reports by a science portal, the black hole appears to be 23 times as massive as the sun but it has crashed into a compact object of about 2.6 solar masses. </p>
